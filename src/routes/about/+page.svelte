	<h1>Alex Ledger</h1>
	<p>
		I'm a web designer and developer from Portland, Oregon. I work with businesses to design and
		build websites.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have worked in software development for over 10 years. In that time, I've worked with great
		institutions like the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, MIT
		Lincoln Laboratory, IBM Watson Health, Point72, and Bank of New York Mellon.
	</p>
	<p>
		Over the years, I've worked on a wide range of projects, from small, local businesses to large,
		international organizations. My contributions have ranged from integrating complex data systems
		to building out the frontend consumer-facing applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		I specialize in creating beautiful, functional websites that help businesses grow. I focus on
		combining good fundamentals— strong, clear copy and design— with a sprinkle of magic to make the
		experience fun and attention-grabbing.
